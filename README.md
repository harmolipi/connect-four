### Functionality

This is the [Connect Four](https://theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code) project, which simply lets you play a round of Connect Four with another person.

### Thoughts

It was definitely very different approaching this one through test-driven development, and it probably took me longer than it would have if I had just written the code directly... but it was a great practice in using rspec, and I came out much more confident in my code at the end. As I adjusted and refactored here and there, running the tests gave me the confidence that I didn't break anything. Additionally, my code came out looking much cleaner and more organized than past projects tended to.

I'd like to continue practicing like this, because I definitely do see TDD as a good strategy to keep on using in the future - especially when tackling more complex projects.

God bless.
